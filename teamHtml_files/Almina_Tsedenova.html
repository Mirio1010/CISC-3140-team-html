    <h3>About myself</h3>
    <p> I like travelling and trying new experiences! My favorite trip was in July 2018, when I spent two weeks eco-volunteering in Iceland. Of course I had to go out and try whale stake (spoiler:it tastes like beef and fish combined). 
        The scariest moment of my travel was in Anchorage, Alaska in 2023, when I couldn't leave my apartment for a couple of hours because there was a wild bear outside! Anyways, now I'm planning on my next adventure to <span style="background-color:black;color:black;padding:0 4px;border-radius:2px;">SECRET LOL</span>!
